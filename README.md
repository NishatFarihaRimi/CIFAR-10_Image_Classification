# Computer Vision Project
# Image Classification with CIFAR-10 and ResNet50

## Project Overview
This project implements an image classification model using the CIFAR-10 dataset. It leverages deep learning techniques with TensorFlow and Keras, including a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the ResNet50 architecture for transfer learning. The goal is to classify images into one of 10 categories with high accuracy.

## Features
Loading and preprocessing of the CIFAR-10 dataset

Use of both custom CNN layers and pre-trained ResNet50 for feature extraction

Model training with Adam optimizer and regularization techniques (L1, L2)

Performance monitoring with Early Stopping to avoid overfitting

Evaluation using confusion matrix and classification report

Visualization support with Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Technologies Used
Python 3.x

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

## Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow scikit-learn

Running the Project
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NishatFarihaRimi/CIFAR-10_Image_Classification.git

cd Desktop/computer_vision_project
```

## Usage
Load and preprocess CIFAR-10 data.

Define the CNN or ResNet50-based model.

Train the model with early stopping.

Evaluate and visualize model performance.
